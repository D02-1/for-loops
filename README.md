### for loops

1. Construct for loops that accomplish the following tasks:

- Print the numbers 0 - 20, one number per line.
- Print only the ODD values from 3 - 29, one number per line.
- Print the EVEN numbers 12 down to -14 in descending order, one number per line.
- Print the numbers 50 down to 20 in descending order, but only if the numbers are multiples of 3.

2. Construct a for loop that sorts the array [2, 3, 13, 18, -5, 38, -10, 11, 0, 104] into two new arrays:

- Define an empty evens array to hold the even numbers and an odds array for the odd numbers.
- In the loop, determine if each number is even or odd, then put that number into evens or odds, as appropriate.
- Print the arrays to confirm the results. Print evens first. Example: console.log(evens);
